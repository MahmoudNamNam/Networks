# Section One

## What is the difference between a network, the internet, and the web?
- **Network**: A group of connected computers sharing information and resources.
- **Internet**: A global network connecting smaller and larger networks worldwide.
- **Web**: A subset of the internet consisting of interconnected web pages and resources accessed using a web browser.

## What are Network Types?
### Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Connects devices within a limited geographical area for data, tool, and program sharing.

- **Network Setup**: Interconnected using `switches` with private addressing via `TCP/IP` protocol.

- **Geographical Coverage**: Typically covers a few kilometers and is privately owned and managed.

- **Speed and Cost**: Fast data transmission with relatively inexpensive hardware.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

covers a **larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN**, connecting computers and devices across cities. MANs can be costly to establish and maintain and may not be owned by a single organization. They offer moderate data transfer rates and propagation delay, using devices like `modems and cables` for data transmission. 

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

A Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a large area and connects multiple Local Area Networks (LANs) using technologies like **telephone lines and radio waves**. It can be limited to an organization or accessible to the public and may involve connections between private networks across different locations. WAN technology offers high-speed connectivity but can be expensive to implement and maintain. Communication mediums used in WANs include the `Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and satellite links` for long-distance transmissions. Designing and maintaining WANs is challenging due to their extensive coverage and reliance on various technologies, leading to increased noise and errors compared to local networks like LANs or MANs.
