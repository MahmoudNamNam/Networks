## What is the difference between a network, the internet, and the web?
- **Network**: A group of connected computers sharing information and resources.
- **Internet**: A global network connecting smaller and larger networks worldwide.
- **Web**: A subset of the internet consisting of interconnected web pages and resources accessed using a web browser.

## What are Network Types?
### Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Connects devices within a limited geographical area for data, tool, and program sharing.

- **Network Setup**: Interconnected using `switches` with private addressing via `TCP/IP` protocol.

- **Geographical Coverage**: Typically covers a few kilometers and is privately owned and managed.

- **Speed and Cost**: Fast data transmission with relatively inexpensive hardware.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

covers a **larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN**, connecting computers and devices across cities. MANs can be costly to establish and maintain and may not be owned by a single organization. They offer moderate data transfer rates and propagation delay, using devices like `modems and cables` for data transmission.
